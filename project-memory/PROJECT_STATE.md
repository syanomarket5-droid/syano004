## Features Intentionally NOT Started
- [ ] Modern Variant System upgrade (Shopify/Amazon/Noon grade) — planned next

## Current Active Feature
**None** — workspace is in stable verified state, awaiting next feature start.

## Next Planned Feature
**Modern Product Variant System** — full marketplace-grade redesign similar to Shopify/Amazon/Trendyol/Noon. See VARIANT_SYSTEM_STATE.md for planning notes.

## Important Implementation Decisions
1. `lib/db`, `lib/api-zod`, `lib/api-client-react` use `exports: { ".": "./src/index.ts" }` — no runtime build step. Declarations built via `npx tsc --build lib/db lib/api-zod lib/api-client-react`.
2. `drizzle-kit push` requires TTY — use `echo "" | drizzle-kit push` or `executeSql` for additive migrations.
3. OTP verification DISABLED via `VERIFICATION_ENABLED` flag in auth.ts — register returns token directly.
4. manualChunks in vite.config.ts must use `/node_modules/pkg/` with slashes (pnpm embeds peer-dep versions in paths).
5. `vendor-react` and `vendor-radix` chunks must NOT be in same chunk (circular dep crash).
6. `AdminListUsersParams.q` was manually added — do NOT regenerate api.schemas.ts without preserving it.
7. Express v5: `req.params` values are `string | string[]` — always wrap with `String()` before `parseInt`.

## Libraries Added Manually (never auto-remove)
- All orval-generated files in `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/` — manually extended
- `api.schemas.ts` — manually extended with: `q` on AdminListUsersParams, `isBestDeal`, `storeName`, `hasVariants`, `flashSale*` fields

## Files Requiring Special Care
- `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/api.schemas.ts` — manually extended, never overwrite
- `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/api.ts` — manually extended
- `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/run-migrations.ts` — additive only, never remove guards
- `artifacts/marketplace/src/i18n/en.json` — all translation keys must be preserved
- `artifacts/marketplace/src/i18n/ar.json` — all translation keys must be preserved
- `artifacts/marketplace/vite.config.ts` — manualChunks is fragile, test after any change

## Things That Must NEVER Be Regenerated Automatically
- OpenAPI spec (manually extended)
- Orval-generated API client (manually extended)
- Database schema (additive only — never drop columns or tables)
- Authentication logic (already working)
- Performance optimizations (already complete)
